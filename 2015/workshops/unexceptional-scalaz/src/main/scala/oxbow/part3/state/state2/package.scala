  The previous example has taken us so far; but what if we are passing in state at the top-level, or wanting to reading in values from config
   (like the path). Perhaps there are multiple sources of rates in a List, for example

   Next I want to consider what happens if we have some source of rates for comparison, say to sanity check those reported to us by Deutsche
    (in case of fat-finger errors). In reality these might (of course) come from a database but here I'm just going to take them from another file.
    Maybe I want to build up the state of all suspicious rates and their sources
