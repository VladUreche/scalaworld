## Training at Scala World

Through our training partners at [Underscore](http://underscore.io/) we will be
offering an advanced, two-day course after the main Scala World event, at the
Rheged Centre.

### Advanced Scala with Scalaz, 23-24 September, with Noel Welsh

Advanced Scala with Scalaz is aimed at experienced Scala developers who want to
take the next step in engineering robust and scalable systems. The course
teaches five key abstractions of monoids, functors, monads, monad transformers,
and applicative functors, using the implementations in the Scalaz library.
Through a series of projects we show you how these abstractions can be used to
engineer solutions to practical problems in data analysis, data validation,
input parsing, error handling, and more.

The main goal of this course is to teach system architecture and design using
the techniques of modern functional programming. This means designing systems
as small composable units, expressing constraints and interactions via the type
system, and using composition to guide the construction of large systems in a
way that maintains the original architectural vision.

The course also serves as an introduction to the Scalaz library. We use
abstractions from Scalaz, and we explain the structure of Scalaz so you can use
it without fear in your own code base. The broad ideas are not specific to
Scalaz, but Scalaz provides an excellent implementation that is beneficial to
learn in its own right.
