## Reactive Apps with Akka and AngularJS

### [Heiko Seeberger](https://twitter.com/hseeberger), 45 minutes

Akka and AngularJS are a great combination for Reactive Apps. Akka takes care
of vertical and horizontal scaling as well as resilience and with AngularJS
it's easy to implement a rich and highly responsive UI talking to an Akka
backend via messages. In this session we will build an exemplary Reactive App
step by step: starting from the stanalone UI we first introduce Akka HTTP and
Server-Sent Events running on a single node and then move on to an elastic and
resilient service built with features like Akka Distributed Data (CRDTs), Akka
Cluster Sharding and Akka Persistence.
