## Beyond Lenses

### [Julien Truffaut](https://twitter.com/JulienTruffaut), 45 minutes

A Lens is a functional concept which solves a very common problem: how to
update a complex immutable structure. This is probably the reason why Lenses
are relatively well known in functional programming languages such as Haskell
or Scala. However, there are far less resources available on the generalization
of Lenses known as "Optics". 

I would like to go through a few of these optics, namely Iso, Prism and
Optional. My goal is to show how they relate to each other and how they can be
used in common programming tasks.
