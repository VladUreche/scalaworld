### [Roland Kuhn](https://twitter.com/rolandkuhn), 60 minutes

The new Actor representation in Akka Typed allows formulations that lend
themselves to monadic interpretation or introspection. This leads us to explore
possibilities for expressing and verifying dynamic properties like the
adherence to a communication protocol between multiple agents as well as the
safety properties of that protocol on a global level. Academic research in this
area is far from complete, but there are interesting initial results that we
explore in this session: precisely how much purity and reasoning can we bring
to the distributed world?
