## Scala Magic: Desugaring Your Reality

### Joost Heijkoop, 45 minutes

Solutions in Scala can often be expressed in more ways then one and Scala
provides a lot of convenient ways to express common patterns/solutions with
very concise syntax. You might take this for granted and you might not always
know that it is just sugar.

During this talk we will explore constructs like for comprehensions, case
classes and more. We will look what the Scala parser actually makes of it,
using `scalac -Xprint` and `jad`.
