## sbt

### [Eugene Yokota](https://twitter.com/eed3si9n), [Dale Wijnand](https://twitter.com/dwijnand), and [Martin Duhem](https://github.com/Duhemm), 60 minutes

Reports on recent progress into sbt 1.0, which splits up some of the modules
into separate repositories, including the incremental compiler by non-Josh
members of the sbt team (This is the first time we meet face to face, so it
could be awkward).

The second half can be used as a general Q&A and workshop about sbt and builds.
