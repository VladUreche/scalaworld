## An attempt to stay DRY across "Real World" System Interfaces.

### [Marco Borst](https://github.com/nmcb), 30 minutes, 45 with demo.

Things, that are existing in the "Real world" like people, apples, cars, orders, buildings, money transfers, etc. are intrinsically hard to describe in a non-uniform, evolvable manner.  Particularly across informational system interfaces.  Creating such systems on either side of the interface while treating the description as the single source of thruth for their implementation is a challenge.  One that needs to be addressed still, as the "Real World" requires cross-system interfaces descriptions that convey the actual meaning of the things and fact that it concists of, understood both by humans as well as machines.  In this talk, we reflect on the issue and place it in a development historical context.  Additionally, we prepered a demo of the Play-Swagger plugin, the prototypical product of a collaboration between Typesafe's Play development team and Zalando engineers tasked with the goal to enable an API First approach employing Typesafe's development stack.
