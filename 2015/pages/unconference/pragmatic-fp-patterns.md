## A pragmatic approach to FP architecture in Scala

### [Raul Raja](https://twitter.com/raulraja), 30 minutes

In this talk we will see a pragmatic approach to building a purely functional architecture.
Through the use of Free Monads, Transformers, Kleisli's, Dependently typed checked exceptions we will achieve 
pure functions that are composable, context free, dependently injectable and testable, all encapsulated in a simple
API that all developers regardless of their FP knowledge can use on any project.
