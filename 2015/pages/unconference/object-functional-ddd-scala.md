## Object-Functional Scala and Domain Driven Design

### [Kevin Mas](https://github.com/kmruiz), 60 minutes

Scala is a blended language, meaning that it's a powerful way to describe
your program. This talk researches about how to merge the most useful features
of the object oriented paradigm and functional programming, also focusing
on how to define a program following the DDD guidelines.

The scratch code for the unconference is [here](https://github.com/kmruiz/scala-object-functional-ddd-unconference).

Those slides try to explain how to take advantage of:

* Function composition
* Polymorphism
* Interface oriented design
* Type-system modeling
* Side-effect free systems
