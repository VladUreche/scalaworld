## Parser macros for Scala

### [Martin Duhem](https://github.com/Duhemm), 15 minutes

Parser macros are a new kind of macro that allow developers to create new
language constructs and to define their own syntax for using them. Parser
macros are implemented on top of scala.meta, the new metaprogramming toolkit,
and we believe that they can make a difference and increase the expressiveness
of Scala code.

In this talk, I will present how parser macros behave with respect to classical
Scala macros and show some of the new possibilities that are opened by our
compiler plugin.
