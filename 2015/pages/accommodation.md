## Staying in the Lake District

As one of the UK’s favourite tourist destinations, the Lake District has a wealth of places to stay, including hotels, self-catering cottages, guesthouses and hostels, not to mention camping. The dates of Scala World are towards the end of the summer tourist season, and although it is after the start of the school term and fewer families will be holidaying at that time, demand for rooms may still be high, so we recommend booking early.

For easy access to the conference, the small towns of Penrith and Keswick both offer a variety of accommodation options, and Carlisle, a little further afield (and outside the National Park) the city of Carlisle, on the historic Hadrian’s Wall, should provide further possibilities. In addition, there are dozens of holiday cottages in the many Lakeland villages all within reach of the venue. However, we would recommend checking journey times before booking, as roads within the Lakes are not always guaranteed to be quick. They are, however, guaranteed to be scenic.
