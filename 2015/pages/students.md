## Student Tickets

We want to do everything we can to encourage students to participate in Scala
World, to hear about the cutting-edge research taking place in academia, and to
nurture links with industry. However, the standard ticket rate may be
prohibitively expensive for many people still in full-time education, so we
will be offering a limited number of tickets for *£120+VAT (£144)*, 75% off the
full price.

This special rate is only available to students involved in a full-time degree
(batchelor’s, master’s, doctorate or equivalent) at a recognized academic
institution. On the registration form, you will be asked to provide the name of
your academic institution, and the course you are enrolled onto. We will carry
out some basic checks to verify these details, and may request further details
by email in the event of any doubt.

If you are unsure about the eligibility of your academic institution or course,
please [ask us by email](mailto:info@scala.world) and we will clarify.
