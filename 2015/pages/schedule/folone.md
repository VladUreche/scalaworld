Almost [exactly a year
ago](http://typelevel.org/blog/2014/09/02/typelevel-scala.html) the Typelevel
Organization has forked scala, and set out on an adventure of essentially being
an incubator for new exciting ideas before (and if) they come to the typesafe
scala. Typelevel's target audience are early adopters.

Join this talk to learn how this experiment is going. We will also get you
started on using tlc (typelevel compiler) in your projects today. Time
permitting, we'll explore ways for you to get contributing to tlc as well as
Typesafe scala.
