Scala stands for “scalable language” and was designed to be able to grow and
evolve. One look at the Scala ecosystem shows that this goal has been
successful — many people have been excited to make Scala their own, and to
extend the state of the art in all directions, based on their needs,
principles, and whimsy.

This Cambrian explosion of expressiveness has brought with it a wide variety of
idioms, conventions, strategies, preferences, and designs. Some of these are
purely stylistic, others are critically-important, and it is not always clear
which are which. Given this massive possibility space, what is a library author
to do?

Starting with a few key principles and design goals, this talk takes a holistic
look at designing useful, efficient, and reliable libraries, with the goal of
supporting a coherent ecosystem around functional programming in Scala. Cats
and Algebra will be used as two real-world examples of libraries that are
designed with these goals in mind, and with similar (but not identical)
constraints.
