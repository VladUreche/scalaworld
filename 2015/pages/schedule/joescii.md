Scala boasts a powerful type system which assists developers in writing and
maintaining bug-free software. Unfortunately, many members of the growing Scala
community struggle to utilize the Scala type system due to prior experience
with poor static type systems or none at all.

This talk aims to narrow the gap between haves and have-nots of typelevel
programming by teaching some basics of type manipulation in Scala.

This presentation is the product of my journey into the Scala type system from
a background in Java. I will review the familiar value-level runtime
programming, and show how the same logic can be utilized at compile time via
the type system. As the title suggests, this is an introduction; no theoretical
background knowledge is required.

By the end of the talk you will be motivated with a new comfort level in types
enabling you to take the plunge into the riches of one of Scala's greatest
features.
