Javaâ€™s experiment with checked Exceptions ended with ignominy, acrimony and
antimony. As the human race evolved more esoteric higher-brain functions,
programming languages with more advanced static type checking arrived and
decided not to bother having the compiler check that you were handling errors
correctly.

Adherents of such languages could either attend this workshop or read 1984 to
familiarize themselves with the concept of doublethink. I will attempt to show
the attendee that it is perfectly possible to write rich and clear programs
without once relying on the use of exceptions to propagate and handle errors.

Ironically, I will fail miserably.
