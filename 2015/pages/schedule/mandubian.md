As FP practitioners, we like to isolate nasty unsafe effects from our
beautifully pure code. One day, delivery has to happen and our functional
application inevitably hits the dysfunctional and unpredictable world.

Then starts the never-ending wandering in the developers’ limbo of
unreproducible bugs.

To ward off the curse and climb back into developers’ paradise, we need to keep
an eye on the runtime to fix and foresee issues without sacrificing compile
time purity.

In this talk we’ll introduce Précepte, a deeply friendly stack of pure
functional structures that will lead you to the happy functional path.
