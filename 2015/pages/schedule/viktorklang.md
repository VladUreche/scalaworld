In this presentation we'll explore fast data streaming using Akka Streams—an
implementation of Reactive Streams—and how to design robust transformation
pipelines—with built-in flow control—able to take advantage of multicore and
traversing networks.

We'll highlight pitfalls and discuss how they can be avoided, as well as
explore how we can define immutable pieces of processing logic—data we can
reuse via composition—a veritable smorgasbord of stream transformations that
transparently takes advantage of multicore hardware when executed.
