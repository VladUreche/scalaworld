Armed with our new knowledge from Chris' talk, we will start working on
some (not too difficult) real-world bug reports from the Scala issue
tracker.

(Almost) no slides, and a lot of live-coding!

We will explore the different parts in the process of making
contributions to scalac, get to know some handy techniques for tackling
bugs, learn to navigate through the codebase, have a look at how to
write tests to prevent regressions and gain an understanding for the
impact of changes.

Bug/feature topics:
 - deprecations and removals
 - enhancing the @throws annotation
 - dealing with static members
 - better desugaring of String concatenation
 - adding support for Java 8 parameter names in class files
 - improving annotation handling (work in progress)
 - macrofying classOf and integrating ClassTag support (work in progress)
