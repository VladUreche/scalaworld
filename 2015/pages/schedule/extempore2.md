Back in 2010, at the inaugural Scala Days in Switzerland, the first major Scala
conference, a then-disparate community of hackers came together to learn and
share ideas about an exciting new programming language. During the conference,
an Icelandic volcano (whose name nobody could pronounce) erupted, causing a
cloud of ash to cover most of Europe, grounding all civilian flights, and
stranding many of the Scala Days attendees in Lausanne, unable to fly home.

But out of this chaos, the community showed its typical resolve and generosity,
and groups of Scala developers came together in the days that followed for food
and beer, hacking sessions, and hastily-made sleeping arrangements. In those
few days, some important code was written, and some great friendships were
established.

So, in that community spirit, and recognizing the role it played in Scala’s
history, Scala World will host the first Eyjafjallajökull Lecture after dinner
on 21 September, to be delivered by the inimitable Paul Phillips.
