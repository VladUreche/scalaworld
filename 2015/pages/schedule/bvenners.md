The Scala standard library includes a large set of collections that
covers a wide variety of use cases. For example, it offers both
mutable and immutable collections, sequential and parallel
collections, strict and lazy collections, and many combinations
thereof.

Although the standard collections library is widely used and
works quite well today, this talk asks the question: how could the
standard collections library be made better? We will look at various
directions the Scala library could potentially evolve in the future,
and discuss design trade-offs and migration strategies.
