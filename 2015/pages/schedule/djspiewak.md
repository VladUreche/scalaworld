Laws are our friends! They make it easier to reason about things by
eliminating possibilities and constraining the problem space. Applying lawful,
principled and reasonable programming to the thorny problem of asynchronous and
concurrent systems seems like a natural fit, but the devil is in the details.

This talk will explore scalaz-stream, both the present and the future designs
at a very low-level. We'll look at where we can apply lawful reasoning and
where we can't. We'll also examine some of our past failures in this area, and
how we think we can do better in upcoming releases.
