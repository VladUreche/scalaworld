Our main hiking day, several groups will set off from starting points at
[Thirlmere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirlmere),
[Grasmere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grasmere) and the Dungeon Ghyll Hotel
in [Great Langdale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Langdale), taking a
choice of scenic routes (some more challenging than others) towards the summits
of [High Raise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Raise_(Langdale)), one of
the highest and most central of the Lakeland Fells, and the famous [Helm
Crag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helm_Crag).

After lunch, and a stop to appreciate the views, there will be a choice of
descents through the delightful Easedale and back into Grasmere, where a
varitety of quaint English tea shops awaits hungry and thirsty travellers.

Be sure to get back to Grasmere before 5.00pm, when the bus leaves for Penrith.
Aim to get back early, as there are plenty of caf√©s and shops to while away the
time in while you wait.
