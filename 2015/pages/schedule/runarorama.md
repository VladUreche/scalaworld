As programmers, we tend to think of expressive power of a language or library
as an unmitigated good. In this talk I want to show the contrary; that
restraint and precision are usually better than power and flexibility. A
constraint on component design leads to freedom and power when putting those
components together into systems.

Whatâ€™s more, this feature is built into the very nature of language and
reasoning.
