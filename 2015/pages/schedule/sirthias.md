The most recent additions to the Akka toolkit, akka-stream and akka-http, offer
an exciting new way to define application logic with a focus on data
transformations, especially, but far from exclusively, when interfacing with
the world via HTTP.

In this double-length session we will build on Viktor's talk from 10.30am and
take an extensive hands-on tour through the new Akka modules by gradually
evolving a small application, combining akka-http's client- and server-side
with general akka-stream pipelining constructs to produce interesting results
with very little code.  During this in-depth demonstration of Akka's stream
transformation DSL we'll have lots of opportunities to discuss the features and
benefits of the akka-stream and akka-http APIs as well as remaining stumbling
points and development areas.

And of course we'll reserve plenty of time for all your questions.
