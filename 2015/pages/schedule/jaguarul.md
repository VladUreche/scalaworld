The Scala ecosystem is growing ever richer in expressive libraries, but Scala
development tools have not kept pace. In the past three Scala conferences there
was an average of three talks on Scala tools per conference, with the notable
exception of Scala by the Bay (only one). If we look beyond the establishment
(Eclipse and IntelliJ) we go down to about one talk per conference!

It is my deeply held belief that Scala will "cross the chasm" only when solid
development tools become available. In this talk I'll discuss the blessing and
the curse of development tools, where we need to go, and a recent development
in debugging asynchronous programs: the Asynchronous Debugger, integrated into
Scala IDE 4.2.0.
