## The Rheged Centre

Scala World will take place at the [Rheged Centre](http://www.rheged.com/) a
modern conference centre near Penrith in the [Lake District National
Park](http://www.lakedistrict.gov.uk/). This beautiful setting provides us with
a great opportunity to combine a passion for functional programming with the
Great Outdoors.

The Rheged Centre has established itself as a local destination for food, the
outdoors, arts and culture, with a selection of unique shops, cafés, a gallery
and a small food hall promoting a fantastic selection of local produce,
including many local ales.

At our disposal for Scala World, we have a large 260-seat auditorium, which
will host the main track of talks, and the smaller Pennine Gallery (for up to
100 people) for the eight workshop sessions planned over the two days. On the
first night of the conference, we will host a three-course [conference
dinner](/dinner) in Rheged’s grand Mountain Hall.

The Rheged Centre is fully wheelchair-friendly, with step-free access to all
areas. Please enquire if you have any particular mobility requirements.

## The Lake District

Choosing to hold a functional programming conference in the Lake District was
no coincidence. Many developers in the Scala community are known to be keen
walkers and mountaineers, and the opportunity to combine a love of programming
with a love of the outdoors was too good to overlook. From “Britain’s favourite
view” at Wast Water in the west, to Grasmere in central Lakeland – described by
William Wordsworth as “the loveiest spot that man hath ever found” – to the
dramatic climbs of Helvellyn and Striding Edge, the Lakes offer some of the
best sights in England.

So where better to come to learn and share Scala ideas?
