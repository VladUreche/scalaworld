## Getting to the Lake District

As one of the more remote areas of Britainâ€™s countryside, most attendees will
need to travel some distance to get to Lakeland. Nevertheless, the Lake
District, in particular Penrith, is well connected. If travelling by car, the
town is just a couple of minutes from the M6 motorway, between Glasgow two
hours to the north, and Manchester two hours to the south. Both cities have
international airports with direct flights to Europe and the USA. Additionally,
Edinburgh, Newcastle and Liverpool airports are all easily within reach by car.

Penrith train station also provides good connections to both Glasgow Airport
(2h20), Manchester Airport (1h40) and to London (3h00), with trains leaving
approximately once an hour to and from each of those locations.

For visitors coming from outside the UK, we recommend flying into Manchester
Airport and either hiring a car, or taking the train directly from the airport
to Penrith. Glasgow and Edinburgh Airports are viable alternatives, with
slightly longer journey times to Penrith by train.

## Getting Around Lake District

Travelling around Lakeland is easiest with a car, but if that is not an option,
public transport is available along the major routes. The [X4 and
X5](https://www.stagecoachbus.com/pdfs/XNCX004.pdf) bus routes pass between the
towns of Penrith and Keswick, both stopping at the Rheged
Centre along the way. Additionally, we will be putting on a free shuttle bus
between Penrith and the Rheged Centre from 8-9am every morning of the
conference, and for an hour after the end of each conference day.

If there is sufficient demand, we will investigate providing a similar bus
service between Keswick and the Rheged Center. Please enquire for more
information.
