Josh and Dick will take a deep dive into one of Scala's more advanced language
constructs: the for expression. In this coding-example-heavy talk we will cover
topics like:

 - For, it's not about looping
 - Work on what's inside, ignore what's outside
 - To yield or not to yield, there is no question
 - Don't mix your types
 - Statements in an expression? (and why you might want to)
 - Pattern Matches
 - Guards
 - In-line assignments
 - Fors within fors
 - Using a for with your own types
 - How it all de-sugars

And much more.

This talk aims to have something for everyone. Whether just starting out with
Scala or a multi-year Scala veteran, there is likely something you didn't know
about for in this talk.
