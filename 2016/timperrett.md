# Enterprise Algebras

Verizon Labs is home to one of the largest Scala-based functional programming teams in North America, and in this talk Timothy Perrett provides an insight into the work of his infrastructure engineering team, in driving adoption of pure-functional programming in a fortune 15 company: from language education and proliferation within the team, to the specific positives and negatives of purely functional programming, when applied at massive scale.

In particular this session exemplifies methods by which users can apply advanced functional programming concepts such as free applicatives and coproducts to solve core business problems, and in addition how such library APIs can be provided to a large development without overwhelming the unfamiliar user.
