# The Type Astronaut's Guide to Shapeless

This workshop is an introduction to [shapeless][link-shapeless],
a library for generic programming in Scala.
It is aimed at developers with little to no experience with shapeless.
However, attendees should be confident with Scala
and have a rough working knowledge
of [algebraic data types][link-tpolecat-adts]
and [type classes][link-kevinwright-type-classes].

We will introduce the main concepts used by shapeless,
including generic representations, isomorphisms,
and dependent and singleton types.
We will then demonstrate programming techniques
to abstract over types and eliminate boilerplate,
paying special attention to one of shapeless' most exciting uses:
automatic derivation of type class instances.

Along the way, we will touch on the ways shapeless is being used
in some of Scala's most ground-breaking open source projects,
including [Circe][link-circe], [Doobie][link-doobie],
[Ensime][link-ensime], [Finch][link-finch],
[frameless][link-frameless], [parboiled2][link-parboiled2],
and [scodec][link-scodec].
