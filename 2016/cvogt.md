# CBT - fast, intuitive, convenient Scala Builds

You may have heard about CBT by now.
This talks gives you a hands-on introduction with live-coding.

But why CBT, when there is already SBT?
Those who master SBT and remember how to use it enjoy immense power.
It's a big step forward from Maven, Ant, etc.
But many of us just copy and paste, hope for the best and often end up
frustrated, including core members of the Scala community.

Does a build tool have to be that complicated in order to solve
the problems SBT solves? You tell me after you have seen CBT.

But SBT is not only complicated but at times very inconvenient.
It suffers from a slow custom shell that does not integrate
well with other command line tools.

CBT is easy to learn and master, lightning fast and integrates well
with the command line. It leverages many things you already know.
Build files are classes. Tasks are defs. Customizations happen via
overrides. All as vanilla Scala code behaving the way you know.

CBT is also very easy to hack. Scala beginners are able to understand
and modify it's source code and write plugins. A small developer 
community formed around CBT and is working on covering important
features like IDE integration.
